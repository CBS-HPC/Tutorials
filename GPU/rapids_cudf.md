# RAPIDS-cuDF: How To Speed Up Pandas in Python By 150x

This tutorial show how to deploy [cuDF - GPU DataFrames](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) on the AAU GPUs avalaible through UCloud. 

"cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library for loading joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data. cuDF leverages [libcudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/libcudf/stable/), a blazing-fast C++/CUDA dataframe library and the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) columnar format to provide a GPU-accelerated pandas API."

It is suggested to watch the following [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl3xCV2bN6E) showcasing the easy of use and increased performance for larger dataframe operation.

Installation and configuration of Rapids on AAU GPU machines are described in detail [here](/Tutorials/GPU/rapids_cuml/).
