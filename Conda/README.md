## Conda

Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R and [more](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).


[*"The Conda package and environment management system is already included in few applications available on UCloud (see, e.g., JupyerLab and PyTorch).For more general uses of Conda and its powerful package manager it is convenient to create a local installation and save it in a UCloud project."*](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/hands-on/conda-setup.html?highlight=conda)
